		<div class="intro">
			<p>Without the usual hustle and bustle of moving from one class to the next and being on campus, pandemic stir craze has become the new norm for many students attending classes virtually. Breaking away from the isolation that comes from cramped bedrooms and apartments has been tough but many have chosen to mix up the monotony of being indoors and find comfort by safely partaking in public outings. Whether through going out for a quick jog, taking a day trip to the city or catching up with friends after getting vaccinated, small excursions have become the way to cope with stress.</p>

			<p>As vaccination rates continue to climb around the world and specifically in the U.S., glimpses of the pre-pandemic era can be seen. Safety protocols in Los Angeles are lessening with the county advancing into the orange tier Apr. 5, giving the green light to partake in indoor activities with others. Restrictions regarding travel have started to lessen and those taking flights no longer need to quarantine if fully vaccinated.</p>

			<p>With cases declining and vaccinations increasing, coronavirus hysteria has started to lighten and people are beginning to come out of their small at-home bubbles. Reentering normal life has been slow but steady. Here are some outings and travels through the lens of some Daily Trojan photographers.</p>
